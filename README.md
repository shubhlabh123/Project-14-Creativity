This is Shubham Somvanshi. Passionate to become a Full Stack Developer.

## Project Name : **Dance Homepage !**

In this project i have created a Dance Homepage from scratch. And i have learnt a lot of things like how to use flex and how css makes life easier , we can manipulate the things in Html with the help of CSS without touching HTML file in terms of positing and direction not in terms of DOM manipulation😅 and learnt about positioning as well in this project.
